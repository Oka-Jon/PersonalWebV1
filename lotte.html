        <p>Website created in order to track uniform, food, and supply orders for approximately 700 volunteers

        <p>This website was created after learning the basics of the Python framework Django. This website was also created
            before diving in deeper into html and mostly css, resulting in the mostly plain aesthetics and structuring.
            The main concept of this website was to create an online version of the previously paper forms that were filled
            in by volunteer committees at the LPGA Lotte Championships. These forms took orders for uniforms, meal requests, and
            supplies that the committees need to operate. 
        </p>
        <img class="lotte-photo2 proj-photo" src="css/images/lotte-uniform.png" alt="">
        <p class="lotte-pt2">The way the website is structured required a login before the user can see the main content. Once
            logged in, there was a to-do list for each user, directing the user to fill out each form to get their order requests.
            Once a form was completed, the to-do list was updated and the completed form was removed to prevent multiple submissions
            that could cause confusion. Each user was also able to edit their forms in case changes needed to be made. For the admins,
            they were able to access a special page that would summarize the completed infomration and return totals for each form. 
            They could also export the numbers into an excel document where each form was a sheet and had a table with the information
            separated by committee.
